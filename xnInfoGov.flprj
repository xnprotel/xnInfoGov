The template consists of several content and project files, with settings already in place to facilitate single-source publishing out of the box. Several target files are included in the project. They have been designed to reuse the same content and quickly send output to HTML5, multiple PDFs, and WebHelp Mobile (which can be used to view output on a smart phone). In addition, a batch target lets you generate all of these outputs at one time with the click of a single button." MasterStylesheet="/Content/Resources/Stylesheets/xpsStyles.css" />
