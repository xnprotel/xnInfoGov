        <h2 class="missionDocument">Mission statement</h2>
        <p>Xn protel Systems ("XPS") helps world-class hospitality companies in over 50 countries to optimise revenue generation, simplify service operations and enhance the quality of guest communications.</p>
        <p>XPS and its employees have an inherent responsibility to protect the physical information assets of the company as well as confidential customer data and intellectual capital owned by the company.  These critical assets must be safeguarded to mitigate any potential impacts to XPS and its customers.  Information Security is a critical business function that should be incorporated into all aspects of XPS business practices and operations. </p>
        <p> 
To achieve this objective, policies, procedures, and standards have been created to ensure secure business practices are in place at XPS.  Information security is a foundational business practice that must be incorporated into planning, development, operations, administration, sales and marketing, as each of these business functions requires specific safeguards to be in place to mitigate the risk associated with normal business activities.
</p>
        <p>XPS is subject to numerous Information Security and Privacy laws and regulations, which if not complied with, could potentially result in fines, audits, loss of customer confidence, and direct financial impacts to the company.  Compliance with all applicable regulations is the responsibility of every employee at XPS.
</p>
        <h2 class="missionDocument">Overview</h2>
        <p>Everyone at XPS is responsible for familiarising themselves with and complying with all XPS policies, procedures and standards dealing with information security.</p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument">Objectives</h3>
        <p>For the purposes of this document, we have borrowed a definition from the U.S. National Information Systems Security glossary; Information Systems Security (INFOSEC) is:</p>
        <p><i>“The protection of information systems against unauthorised access to or modification of information, whether in storage, processing or transit, and against the denial of service to authorised users or the provision of service to unauthorised users, including those measures necessary to detect, document, and counter such threats.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>Information Security focuses on three objectives for protecting information: </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11pt;">Confidentiality</li>
            <li style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11pt;">Integrity</li>
            <li style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11pt;">Availability. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The policies in this document support these objectives.</p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument">Why do we need information security?</h3>
        <p>XPS requires information security to protect information assets from security threats.  It is critical to protect the system environment to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, to ensure profitability, and to secure and maintain member and partner trust and confidence.</p>
        <p>Security threats originate at a wide variety of sources, including computer-assisted fraud, industrial espionage, sabotage, vandalism and natural disasters.  Computer viruses, unethical hacking and denial of service attacks are examples of threats encountered while operating over the Internet.  These types of threats are becoming increasingly more common, more ambitious and more sophisticated.</p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument">Intent and direction</h3>
        <p> Three mutually compatible tenets provide the intent and direction for this document:
</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Security is everyone’s responsibility.  Maintaining an effective and efficient security posture for XPS requires a proactive stance on security issues from everyone.  Security is not “somebody else’s problem;” as a member of XPS, you have the responsibility to adhere to the security policies and procedures of the company and to take issue with those who are not doing the same.
</li>
            <li> Security permeates the XPS organisation.  Security is not just focused on physical and technical “border control.” Rather, XPS seeks to ensure reasonable and appropriate levels of security awareness and protection throughout our organization and infrastructure.  There is no place in our business where security is not a consideration.
</li>
            <li> Security is a business enabler.  A strong security foundation, proactively enabled and maintained, becomes an effective market differentiator for our company.  Security has a direct impact on our viability within the marketplace, and must be treated as a valued commodity.
The tenets of our philosophy of protection are mutually supportive; ignoring any one tenet in favor of another undermines the overall security posture of our organisation.
</li>
        </ol>
