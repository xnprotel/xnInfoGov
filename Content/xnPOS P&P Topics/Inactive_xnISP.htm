        <h1 style="page-break-before: avoid;" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Mission statement</h1>
        <p>Xn protel Systems ("XPS") helps world-class hospitality companies in over 50 countries to optimise revenue generation, simplify service operations and enhance the quality of guest communications.</p>
        <p>XPS and its employees have an inherent responsibility to protect the physical information assets of the company as well as confidential customer data and intellectual capital owned by the company.  These critical assets must be safeguarded to mitigate any potential impacts to XPS and its customers.  Information Security is a critical business function that should be incorporated into all aspects of XPS business practices and operations. </p>
        <p> 
To achieve this objective, policies, procedures, and standards have been created to ensure secure business practices are in place at XPS.  Information security is a foundational business practice that must be incorporated into planning, development, operations, administration, sales and marketing, as each of these business functions requires specific safeguards to be in place to mitigate the risk associated with normal business activities.
</p>
        <p>XPS is subject to numerous Information Security and Privacy laws and regulations, which if not complied with, could potentially result in fines, audits, loss of customer confidence, and direct financial impacts to the company.  Compliance with all applicable regulations is the responsibility of every employee at XPS.
</p>
        <h1 MadCap:autonum="2. ">Policy overview</h1>
        <p>Everyone at XPS is responsible for familiarising themselves with and complying with all XPS policies, procedures and standards dealing with information security.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="2.1 ">Objectives </h2>
        <p>For the purposes of this document, we have borrowed a definition from the U.S. National Information Systems Security glossary; Information Systems Security (INFOSEC) is:</p>
        <p><i>“The protection of information systems against unauthorised access to or modification of information, whether in storage, processing or transit, and against the denial of service to authorised users or the provision of service to unauthorised users, including those measures necessary to detect, document, and counter such threats.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>Information Security focuses on three objectives for protecting information: </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11pt;">Confidentiality</li>
            <li style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11pt;">Integrity</li>
            <li style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11pt;">Availability. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The policies in this document support these objectives.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="2.2 ">Why do we need information security?</h2>
        <p>XPS requires information security to protect information assets from security threats.  It is critical to protect the system environment to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, to ensure profitability, and to secure and maintain member and partner trust and confidence.</p>
        <p>Security threats originate at a wide variety of sources, including computer-assisted fraud, industrial espionage, sabotage, vandalism and natural disasters.  Computer viruses, unethical hacking and denial of service attacks are examples of threats encountered while operating over the Internet.  These types of threats are becoming increasingly more common, more ambitious and more sophisticated.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="2.3 ">Intent and direction</h2>
        <p> Three mutually compatible tenets provide the intent and direction for this document:
</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Security is everyone’s responsibility.  Maintaining an effective and efficient security posture for XPS requires a proactive stance on security issues from everyone.  Security is not “somebody else’s problem;” as a member of XPS, you have the responsibility to adhere to the security policies and procedures of the company and to take issue with those who are not doing the same.
</li>
            <li> Security permeates the XPS organisation.  Security is not just focused on physical and technical “border control.” Rather, XPS seeks to ensure reasonable and appropriate levels of security awareness and protection throughout our organization and infrastructure.  There is no place in our business where security is not a consideration.
</li>
            <li> Security is a business enabler.  A strong security foundation, proactively enabled and maintained, becomes an effective market differentiator for our company.  Security has a direct impact on our viability within the marketplace, and must be treated as a valued commodity.
The tenets of our philosophy of protection are mutually supportive; ignoring any one tenet in favor of another undermines the overall security posture of our organisation.
</li>
        </ol>
        <h1 MadCap:autonum="3. ">Policies</h1>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="3.1 ">Information Security Policy Document</h2>
        <p>XPS Executive Management will provide direction for, approve, publish and communicate the merits of an Information Security Policy document. This document shall outline management's approach to Information Security as well as providing the organisation with a strong indication of the management’s commitment to Information Security within XPS.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this policy is to communicate the direction of XPS Information Security program by providing relevant, accessible and understandable definitions, statements and explanations.</p>
        <p>The Information Security Policy Document shall:</p>

            <li>Outline specific responsibilities for information security management.</li>
            <li>Outline policies and procedures for reporting security incidents.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Information Security Policy Document shall serve as a reference document that will lead to additional more detailed information when necessary (for instance employee manuals etc.).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="3.2 ">Policy review and evaluation</h2>
        <p>The Group Technical Infrastructure Director shall be the owner of this Information Security Policy Document. The owner of the document shall be responsible for maintaining and reviewing the policy based upon a defined review process. The policy shall be reviewed at least annually and updated in response to any changes that would affect such as significant security incidents, new vulnerabilities, new regulations or changes to XPS infrastructure.</p>
        <p>The reviews shall include an assessment of the policy’s effectiveness based upon: the nature and number and impact of recorded security incidents; cost and impact of controls on business efficiency; and the effects of changes to technology.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="3.3 ">Document conventions</h2>
        <p>The following is a list of conventions used in this document:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>Use of the word <b>shall</b> indicates a mandatory requirement.</li>
            <li>Use of the word <b>should</b> indicates a requirement for good practice, which should be implemented whenever possible.</li>
            <li>Use of the word <b>may</b> indicates a desirable requirement.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1 MadCap:autonum="4. ">Access Management</h1>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="4.1 ">Business requirement</h2>
        <h3 style="font-weight: normal;" MadCap:autonum="4.1.1 ">Access Controls and  least privilege</h3>
        <p>Technical Services should define and document access control rights and rules for each user or group of users. Service providers shall be given clear statements of the business requirements met by these access controls.  Access to information and information services will only be given on the basis of least priviledge.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>Access will be given on a need to know basis, based upon the security requirements and business requirements of individual business applications.  Access to information shall be provided in a manner that aims to protect the confidentiality and integrity of that information and without compromise to associated information or raw data. Data owners shall review access control rights for users and groups of users on a bi-annual basis to ensure that all access rights are authorized and remain appropriate, and that no unauthorized privileges have been gained
</li>
            <li>All forums where confidential information may be discussed and where non-[COMPANY] employees are present shall be preceded by a determination that all parties are authorized to receive the information and the appropriate categorization of that information.
</li>
            <li>Access will be given that is consistent with security levels and classifications, consistent with legislation and contractual obligations for confidentiality.
</li>
            <li>Access to standard common groups of users will be given standard access profiles.
</li>
            <li>Access rights in a networked environment will recognize all connection types available.
</li>
            <li>All users and groups of users shall receive a clear statement as to the access policy and as to the requirements met by these access controls.
</li>
            <li>Originators of confidential information shall decide who will be permitted to gain access to that information, and shall specify the uses for that information.
</li>
            <li>Administrator access to production systems will be limited to only those with a justified business requirement for such access.  Developers and other application personnel will not have access to the underlying operating system on production systems, except in emergencies and then with access only granted for the time necessary.  System administrators shall not have access to the applications if possible.
</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="font-weight: normal;" MadCap:autonum="4.1.2 ">Types of access controls</h3>
        <p>Technical Services  should established clear access control rules that distinguish between optional, express, discretionary, automatic and those that require approval.
</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>Access rules should specifically differentiate between those rules that are optional or conditional and those that are always to be enforced.
</li>
            <li>Access rules should be declarative statements such as “access is forbidden unless specifically permitted” instead of “access is generally permitted unless forbidden”
XPS Information Security Policy
P a g e | 25
</li>
            <li>Access rules should differentiate between those rules that require approval and those that do not.
</li>
            <li>Access rules should consider changes in classifications that are automatic (see 9.2) and those classification changes that must be initiated by an administrator.
</li>
            <li>Access rules for each system should be developed in according with this policy commensurate with the information’s sensitivity.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="4.2 ">User Access Management</h2>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="4.2.1 ">User Registration</h3>
        <p>A formal user registration and deregistration process should be used for gaining access to multi-user systems. This process must protect and maintain the security of access to XPS information resources through the complete life cycle of the user.</p>
        <p>a. Access to XPS confidential information shall be provided only after the authorisation of the information owner has been obtained.</p>
        <p>b. Contractors and third party contracts should contain the rights of access and should contain sanctions if unauthorised attempts at access are made (see <b>Terms and Conditions of Employment and Disciplinary Process</b>)</p>
        <p>c. Service providers and vendors shall be made aware of the policy which not to provide access to users until specific authorisation has been given.</p>
        <p>d. Each person accessing a multi-user based information system shall utilise a unique assigned User ID and a private password. User IDs shall not be shared among two or more users.</p>
        <p>e. System owners and/or GSA shall grant access rights. Formal records of all access rights for each information system shall be maintained.</p>
        <p>f. Access rights shall immediately be removed or modified when a user leaves the organisation, terminated, retired, or transferred.</p>
        <p>Group MIS will periodically check for redundant IDs and ensuring that redundant IDs are not issued in excess of that required (i.e., administrators may have a privileged and a non-privileged account on the same system, but an average user should not have two different non-privileged accounts on the same system without a valid business reason).</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="4.2.2 ">Privilege Management
</h3>
        <p>User rights shall be granted using the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP), based on business need and security requirements.
</p>
        <p>All privileges shall be granted only with formal authorisation. This authorisation shall be accomplished along with User ID authorisation. All privileges that are granted will be documented. No privileges shall be granted until authorisation is complete.
</p>
        <p>Elevated Privileges (EP) (Administrator or root, etc.) should be assigned to a different user ID than that used for normal business use. Administrators should only use their elevated privilege accounts when conducting activities that actually require them. Elevated privileges must only be assigned to dedicated systems administrators and not normal users.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="4.2.3 ">User Password Management
</h3>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>A user’s account and password is the primary means of verifying a user’s identity. The allocation of passwords will be a formal management process.</li>
            <li>Users will sign a statement in their terms and conditions of employment (see 8.1.2) that they will keep their personal or group passwords confidential. This may be done as part of the overall acceptance of policies.
</li>
            <li>Users will be responsible for the secure of their passwords.</li>
            <li>Users will be granted initial temporary passwords and will be forced to change them immediately. Temporary passwords will only be granted with positive identification of the user.
</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="4.2.4 ">Review of User Access Rights
</h3>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>Users’ access rights shall be reviewed at regular intervals. Head of department will review their staff’s rights to ensure they are consistent with their present job function.</li>
            <li>Technical Services will review user rights to ensure that elevated privileges have not been granted out without authorisation, and that accounts that have not been used recently or belong to terminated employees are deactivated or purged.
</li>
            <li>User access rights shall be reviewed at least every 6 months. Privileged access rights shall be reviewed every 3 months to ensure that all are authorised and remain appropriate and that no unauthorised privileges have been gained.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="4.3 ">User responsibility</h2>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="4.3.1 ">Password use</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish a standard for creation of strong passwords, the protection of those passwords, and the frequency of change.</p>
        <p>Passwords are an important aspect of computer security. They are the front line of protection for user accounts. A poorly chosen password may result in the compromise of the XPS corporate network. As such, all XPS employees (including contractors and vendors with access to XPS systems) are responsible for taking the appropriate steps, as outlined below, to select and secure their passwords.</p>
        <p>The scope of this policy includes all personnel who have or are responsible for an account (or any form of access that supports or requires a password) on any system that resides at any XPS facility, has access to the XPS network, or stores any non-public XPS information.</p>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="4.3.1.1 "> <span>User Password Rules</span></h4>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>XPS</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="4.3.1.2 ">System Password Rules
</h4>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>System accounts (i.e., non-interactive accounts for specific applications or systems) must use passwords that meet or exceed the password composition requirements (see 10.3.1.3). </li>
            <li>System-level passwords must be changed at least once every 90 days.
</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="4.3.1.3 ">Password Composition
</h4>
        <p>All user-level and system-level passwords must conform to the requirement described below.
</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li> Passwords shall be at least 8 non-sequential characters long.</li>
            <li>Passwords shall be composed of alpha-numeric characters.</li>
            <li>Passwords shall contain all of the 4 characteristics below:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li>alphabet character (a, b, c…z)
</li><li>upper case letter (A, B, C…Z)
</li><li>number (0, 1, 2, 3…9)
</li><li>special character (@, $, !...etc.)</li></ol></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="4.3.2 ">Unattended User Equipment
</h3>
        <p>Users shall protect XPS information resources from unauthorised access by protecting unattended equipment:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li> Users will terminate active sessions when finished (or unattended) or secure by appropriate locking functions.</li>
            <li>Users should log-off of multi-user systems when finished.</li>
            <li>A password-protected screen saver should be automatically invoked after 15 minutes of inactivity.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="4.4 ">Acceptable use </h2>
        <p>The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of computer equipment at XPS. This will help protect XPS employees, partners and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly. Inappropriate use exposes XPS to risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services, and legal issues. All users are expected to be familiar with and comply with this policy.</p>
        <p>All XPS systems are to be used for business purposes in serving the interests of the company, and of XPS clients and members in the course of normal operations, although occasional use of XPS computer systems for personal use is acceptable.</p>
        <p>Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of every XPS employee and affiliate who deals with information and/or information systems. It is the responsibility of every computer user to know this policy, and to conduct his/her activities accordingly.</p>
        <p>This policy applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporaries, and other workers at XPS, including all personnel affiliated with third parties. This policy applies to all equipment that is owned or leased by XPS and personal equipment that is used to connect to XPS network.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="4.4.1 ">General Use and Ownership
</h3>
        <p>While XPSnetwork administration desires to provide a reasonable level of privacy, users should be aware that the data they create on the corporate systems remains the property of XPS. Because of the need to protect the XPSnetwork, management cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information stored on any network device belonging to XPS.
</p>
        <p>Employees are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding the reasonableness of personal use. Technical Services is  responsible for creating guidelines concerning personal use of Internet/Intranet/Extranet systems. In the absence of such policies, and if there is any uncertainty, employees should consult Technical Services staff or the Group Technical Infrastructure Director.
</p>
        <p>Employee shall exercise due diligence to protect sensitive or confidential data or material. For guidelines on information classification, see 9.2.

For security and network maintenance purposes, MIS Staff have the right to monitor equipment, systems and network traffic at any time.</p>
